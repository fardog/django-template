django-template
===============

Basic django+foundation template for new projects. This still needs work, but
is intended to launch a new django project, plus Zurb Foundation. It's designed
as I prefer; might not be suitable for you.


Usage
-----

To launch a new project, use `fab setup:<app_name>`
